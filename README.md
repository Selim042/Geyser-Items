# Geyser Items
The Geyser project is an re-imagining of the old Spout project that extended what Bukkit plugins were capable of by using client-side mods.  Geyser Recipes is the first in the Geyser suite of mod/plugins that will aim to do the same, extend what Bukkit plugins are capable of doing.

Geyser Items allows plugins to create completely new items with custom functionality, models, and textures.  Requires Geyser Resources.
